# NightVim

NightVim is a [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
layer to configure Neovim installations. Think
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), but Nix handles all the
dependencies, updating together with the rest of the system and with all
niceties you have come to expect from Nix (atomicity, simple rollbacks).
